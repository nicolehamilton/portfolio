    <h2 style="clear: both;">About</h2>
    <h4>Education</h4>
    <p> I studied Fine Arts at Cornell University, and was obsessed with the intersection of design, communication, and information science. My favorite assignments were analyzing studies of products and how they affect users. For example, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563214007018">this study</a> where it was discovered that the more aware a user is of their Facebook account, the more psychological distress they experience.</p>
    <h4>Career</h4>
    <p>I began my career through internships in design and product management roles to find what I liked best.  My first experience was designing logos and websites as a Design Intern at <i>Sports Illustrated</i>.  Next, I interned at eBay as a Product Management and Design Intern, managing and designing a B2B portal for eBay’s largest sellers. After, I interned at Organic Inc. creating advertising campaigns.</p>
    <p>Upon graduating, I started at AOL and quickly went from designing small modules to creating entire, cross-platform experiences from flows to specs. At Tumblr, I led the UX & UI design for multiple new, top-priority features. Right now I’m leading design for Sign Up, Login, Cancellation, Ecommerce, and Workshop Finder at WW (formerly Weight Watchers).</p>
    <h4>Coding</h4>
    <p>I decided to take this class because I work with coders everyday, but am limited in my knowledge of what specifically they do.</p>

      <h4>My First Webpage</h4>
      <p>In this project I made a website about my class and what I'm learning in it. I also list my favorite people, websites, and ice cream flavors. This is mainly coded in HTML with a little CSS.</p>
      <ul>
       <li>
         <a href="https://nicolehamilton.github.io/my-first-webpage/">My First Webpage (Page)</a>

    </p>
    <p>
      <h4>Resort</h4>
      <p>In this project I made a website about a fictional resort. I didn't get very far, but the goal of this project was to practice CSS, branching, and merging. The languages I used are HTML and CSS.</p>
